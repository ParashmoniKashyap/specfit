# Package for Spectral Fit of the Interferometric Molecular Line Data in Protoplantary Disks
- The most easy-to-use package for spectral modeling of the line emission
- Useful functions to determine column density, excitation temperature, and gas density from observed spectra
- Several useful functions for querying the spectroscopic data from (currently) CDMS (JPL and other will be available soon)
